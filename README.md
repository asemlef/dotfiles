# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for configuring zsh, vim/neovim, tmux, and more. Works for both Linux and MacOS. For best results, use a monospace font from [Nerd Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com/) in the terminal.

## Scripts

+ `bootstrap`: Create dotfile symlinks using [snowsaw](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/snowsaw). Requires python 3.
+ `pyenv.sh`: Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and create a dotfiles virtualenv with the necessary pip packages. This is not required, but will ensure neovim has its python dependencies.
